# Converter-from-CSV-to-MongoDB

🤖 Discord Bot for Data Conversion 📊

This Python script utilizes the Interactions library to create a powerful Discord bot with data conversion capabilities. The bot listens for events and responds to user interactions, providing a seamless experience for Discord server members.

🔹 Features:
- **Startup Event**: The bot prints a message when it finishes loading, ensuring a smooth start.
- **Convert Command**: Users can trigger the "convert" slash command to convert data from a CSV file and store it in a MongoDB database. This command is exclusive to the authorized user.
- **MongoDB Integration**: The bot establishes a connection to a MongoDB Atlas cluster, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Embed Message**: Upon completing the conversion process, the bot sends an attractive embed message to the Discord channel, notifying users about the successful conversion.

🚀 The bot is ready to handle large datasets and simplify data management for server administrators. It offers seamless integration with MongoDB, ensuring secure and scalable storage for user data.
